# sparkExamples
A Series of Spark (Scala, R, Python) Scripts used to Analyze Data.
## Script Types
There is more than one way to do the same thing ( Multiple solutions to one problem ).
As I find new and interesting ways of dealing with common problems, I will add the scripts
here for those that are intersted.  FYI, I usually start solving big problems by building
smaller solutions. You typically won't see a big solution on here for NDA reasons. However,
There should be enough information to glean ideas, how to's, relevancy, optimize, etc.
## Have fun!
